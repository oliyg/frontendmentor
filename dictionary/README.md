## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- ESLint & Prettier
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - FrontEnd Tooling

### What I learned

I learned how to use **Tailwind** to styling the elements.

Here is an article [CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) explained why we use tailwind.

And after reading this artile, I write something here [comment](https://dev.to/oliyg/comment/26ifo).
